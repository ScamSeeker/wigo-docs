# How to Add/Remove Liquidity

Liquidity plays a pivotal role in WigoSwap’s Decentralized Exchange. In order to add liquidity for a particular token pair, you only have to stake the tokens in the platform. Once you add liquidity, you start obtaining rewards in the form of the trading fees generated for that certain token pair you’ve staked. Furthermore, you receive LP Tokens that in turn can be staked in the Farms for gaining WIGO tokens.&#x20;



### **How to Add Liquidity:**&#x20;

In order to add liquidity, you only have to deposit a certain amount of each token in a pair. To make things clear, an example is provided in what follows. In this example FTM-WIGO pair is used.



1\. Open the Liquidity tab.

2\. Click on Add Liquidity.

3\. Now you will see a section that has two separate parts. On the upper part, select the desired currency for which you want to add liquidity from the dropdown menu. In this example we are using FTM.&#x20;

4\. On the lower part of this section, choose the other currency for which you want to provide liquidity. In our example WIGO is selected.&#x20;

5\. Entering the amount of one of the tokens in the desired pair will lead to the amount of the other token being calculated automatically.&#x20;

6\. Make sure that you have sufficient amounts of the tokens you want to add liquidity to. Otherwise, you will be unable to proceed to the next step.

7\. Once you entered the desired amounts for the tokens, you need to click on “Enable WIGO”. You might need to click on this button twice if you are adding liquidity to a pair that involves a token other than FTM.&#x20;

8\. After enabling WIGO, you can then click on the “Supply” button.

9\. Confirm the transaction through your wallet.&#x20;

10\. Following the confirmation, you are able to view the amount of LP Tokens you possess at the bottom of the page.&#x20;



### **How to Remove Liquidity:**&#x20;

1\. Open the “Liquidity” tab.&#x20;

2\. Select the token pair from which you decide to remove the liquidity.&#x20;

3\. By clicking on the “Remove Liquidity” button, you can select the amount of liquidity you want to remove from the given options (namely, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%).&#x20;

4\. Your wallet will then ask you to confirm the operation.&#x20;

5\. To proceed to the next step following the confirmation, click on the “Remove” button.

6\. In the next section you can see the amount of each token you are going to receive. By clicking on the “confirm” button, your wallet will ask you to confirm the action for a second time.&#x20;

7\. Finally, you obtain the previously estimated amounts of each token in the pair. In case you have only removed a part of your liquidity, the remaining amount is updated on “My Liquidity” tab.&#x20;
