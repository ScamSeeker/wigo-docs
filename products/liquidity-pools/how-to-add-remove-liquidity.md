# How to Add/Remove Liquidity

Liquidity plays a pivotal role in WigoSwap’s Decentralized Exchange. In order to add liquidity for a particular token pair, you only have to stake the tokens in the platform. Once you add liquidity, you start obtaining rewards in the form of the trading fees generated for that certain token pair you’ve staked. Furthermore, you receive LP Tokens that in turn can be staked in the Farms for gaining WIGO tokens.&#x20;



### **How to Add Liquidity:**&#x20;

In order to add liquidity, you only have to deposit a certain amount of each token in a pair. To make things clear, an example is provided in what follows. In this example **FTM-USDC** pair is used.



1- Connect your wallet ([How to Connect?](../../get-started/connect-your-wallet-to-wigoswap.md))

2- Open the [Liquidity](https://wigoswap.io/liquidity) page.

4- Now you will see a section that has two separate parts. On the upper part, select the desired token for which you want to add liquidity from the dropdown menu. In this example we are using **FTM**.

5- On the lower part of this section, choose the other token for which you want to provide liquidity. In our example **USDC** is selected.

6- Entering the amount of one of the tokens in the desired pair will lead to the amount of the other token being calculated automatically.

7- Make sure that you have sufficient amounts of the tokens you want to add liquidity to. Otherwise, you will be unable to proceed to the next step.

8- Once you entered the desired amounts for the tokens, you need to click on **Enable USDC** button. You might need to click on this button twice if you are adding liquidity to a pair that involves a token other than FTM.

9- Confirm the enabling through your wallet.
