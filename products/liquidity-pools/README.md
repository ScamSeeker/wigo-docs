# ðŸ’° Liquidity Pools

Providing the liquidity pools with certain liquidity results in users receiving Wigo-LP tokens, and also a share of the fees generated.&#x20;



### **Wigo-LP Tokens:**&#x20;

Letâ€™s make this clear through an example. Consider that you deposit WIGO and FTM Into the liquidity pool. You would then receive WIGO-FTM LP tokens. Needless to say, the amount of Wigo-LP tokens you receive is a manifestation of your share in the WIGO/FTM liquidity pool. You can claim your funds at any given moment by simply removing your liquidity from the pool.&#x20;



### **Earning Trading Fees by Providing Liquidity:**

As users of the platform use the liquidity pool in which youâ€™ve deposited liquidity, you will receive rewards in the form of the fees generated as a result of trading. Trading on WigoSwap costs the traders a 0.19% fee. 0.18% of this amount is added to the certain liquidity pool users are trading in.&#x20;

For the sake of clarity an example is provided:

* The amount of liquidity in a pool is 10 WIGO and 10 FTM. Therefore, there are 10 Wigo-LP tokens that represent this amount.&#x20;
* As a result, 1 Wigo-LP token = 1 WIGO + 1 FTM.
* Consider that a trader trades 10 WIGO for 10 FTM. Another trader also trades 10 FTM for 10 WIGO.&#x20;
* The liquidity pool, namely WIGO/FTM now has 10.018 WIGO and 10.018 FTM.&#x20;
* Caused by the fees generated, Wigo-LP tokens are now worth 1.0018 WIGO + 1.0018 FTM each.&#x20;

To unlock the full financial potential of providing liquidity to the pools, WigoSwap enables you to use your Wog-LP tokens on [WigoFarm](../wigofarm/) so that you can gain higher yields. Moreover, you still benefit from the rewards obtained in the form of trading fees.&#x20;



### **Impermanent Loss (IL)**

Providing liquidity is not without risk. Impermanent Loss happens when the price of the assets youâ€™ve deposited into the pool changes compared to when you deposited them. This concept is an indispensable part of providing the pools with liquidity.&#x20;
