# Swap

WigoSwap is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) with the Decentralized Exchange playing a pivotal role in its ecosystem. Operating as a comprehensive AMM on the Fantom Blockchain, WigoSwap’s goal is to lead users on their way to decentralization.

The above is to be achieved through offering various services:



### **Swapping/Trading:**&#x20;

With the advent of Decentralized Exchanges users are not obliged to use centralized exchanges any more. Using WigoSwap, all of the operations of the users are done via their own wallets. Therefore, there is no longer the need to trust third-party actors with your assets.

When you make a token swap (trade) on the exchange you will pay a **0.19% trading fee**, which is broken down as follows:

**0.18%** - Returned to Liquidity Pools in the form of a fee reward for liquidity providers.\
**0.01%** - Sent towards buyback, burn & reward mechanism.



### **Liquidity Pools:**

Provided that there is sufficient liquidity for certain tokens, users are able to swap tokens. However, lack of liquidity for the tokens you want to swap might make the operation hard, costly, or even impossible.&#x20;

Users who provide liquidity to the liquidity pools will be granted LP tokens. The users are incentivized through the fees generated as a result of trading on the platform. In this way, the existence of liquidity for the DEX is guaranteed to a certain extent.&#x20;

### **Yield Farming:**&#x20;

As users provide the platform with liquidity, they earn WIGO tokens as their reward. This in turn leads to a minimization of the risk of impermanent loss which is inherent in protocols that lock users’ liquidity.

### **Initial Farm Offerings (IFOs):**&#x20;

IFOs are fundraising models that allow new projects to raise funds through participating in pre-sale events. IFO feature coming soon on WigoSwap and users could have the opportunity to buy new tokens at reasonable prices.&#x20;
