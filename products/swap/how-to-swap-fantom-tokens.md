# How to Swap Fantom Tokens

Swapping/Trading has never been easier on WigoSwap. This is made possible by offering users a convenient interface to interact with. Moreover, the necessary calculations are automatically done for you.



### **Starting to Trade:**&#x20;

First and foremost, you need a Fantom-compatible wallet. The necessary information on how to set one up is provided [<mark style="color:blue;">here</mark>](../../get-started/connect-your-wallet-to-wigoswap.md). You also need some Fantom FRC20 tokens. You can check [<mark style="color:blue;">here</mark>](../../get-started/get-frc20-tokens.md) to learn how you can obtain the tokens.



### **Trading on the WigoSwap Exchange:**&#x20;

3- In the following section you can simply choose the tokens you want to trade using “from” and “to”. Select the token you want to trade from by clicking on the dropdown menu. For example, you can trade from **FTM** to **USDC** or **WIGO**. As it can be seen in the picture, the amount of the token you possess is shown above the amount field. You also need to enter the amount of the token you want to trade to. Typing the amount in one of the sections, namely “from” and “to”, will lead the amount in the other section to be estimated automatically. In simple words, if you enter the amount of FTM you want to trade from, the amount of USDC or WIGO you will receive is calculated for you.

4- After checking the details of the trade, click “Swap”.
