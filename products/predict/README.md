# 🎮 Predict

PREDICT is the first decentralized and fun FTM price prediction mini-game on WigoSwap.

{% hint style="success" %}
There is just one rule: Predict FTM price (up or down) and win!
{% endhint %}

\
How to participate? It's really easy:

1. Predict if the price of FTMUSD will be higher or lower than it was when the “LIVE” phase starts.
2. If you enter an “UP” position, and the “Closed Price” is higher than the “Locked Price” at the end of the 15-minute LIVE phase, you WIN! And if it’s lower, you lose.
3. If you enter a “DOWN” position, and the “Closed Price” is higher than the “Locked Price” at the end of the 15-minute LIVE phase, you LOSE! If it’s lower, you win.
