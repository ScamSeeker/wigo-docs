# ↔ Swap

WigoSwap is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) with the Decentralized Exchange playing a pivotal role in its ecosystem. Operating as a comprehensive AMM on the Fantom Blockchain, WigoSwap’s goal is to lead users on their way to decentralization.

The above is to be achieved through offering various services:



### **Swapping/Trading:**&#x20;

With the advent of Decentralized Exchanges, users are no longer obliged to use centralized exchanges. Using WigoSwap, all users' operations are done via their wallets. Therefore, there is no longer the need to trust third-party actors with your assets.

When you make a token swap (trade) on the exchange, you will pay a **0.19% trading fee**, which is broken down as follows:

**0.18%** - Returned to Liquidity Pools in the form of a fee reward for liquidity providers.\
**0.01%** - Sent towards Gamified Burning Mechanism (GBM).



### **Liquidity Pools:**

Users can swap tokens if there is sufficient liquidity for specific tokens. However, a lack of liquidity for the tokens you want to swap might make the operation complex, costly, or even impossible.&#x20;

Users who provide liquidity to the liquidity pools will be granted Wigo-LP tokens. The users are incentivized through the fees generated from trading on the platform. In this way, the existence of liquidity for the DEX is guaranteed to a certain extent.&#x20;

### **Yield Farming:**&#x20;

As users provide the platform with liquidity, they earn WIGO tokens as their reward. Users who provide the platform with liquidity lead to minimizing the risk of impermanent loss, which is inherent in protocols that lock users’ liquidity.
