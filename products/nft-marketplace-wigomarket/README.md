# ðŸ–¼ NFT Marketplace (WigoMarket)

**We believe in art & not only try to be good artists ourselves in the development of our products but also to help great artists expose their works in the best way possible.**

\
As part of our commitment to offer a comprehensive DeFi and GameFi experience, WigoSwap features a state-of-the-art NFT marketplace. Here, users can buy, sell, and trade unique digital assets, including our native Wiggies. Our marketplace is more than just a platform; it's a vibrant, digital bazaar where creativity, culture, and commerce intersect.

Each NFT on our marketplace represents a unique digital asset. From art and collectibles to music and virtual real estate, the WigoSwap NFT marketplace offers something for every digital enthusiast. For creators, our marketplace provides a platform to monetize their digital creations in a secure and transparent manner.

As part of our WigoSwap ecosystem, the NFT marketplace is seamlessly integrated with our other services. This means that you can earn WIGO tokens or Galactic Credits and use them to acquire unique NFTs. Or you can level-up your Wiggies or discover hidden gems in your WigoGalaxy quests. Our marketplace is more than a trading platformâ€”it's a hub of digital creativity and a key component of our GameFi vision.

**It is necessary to note that we prefer to place collections in the marketplace that have a high artistic value and unfortunately, we cannot accept all artists' works at the moment. If you want your NFT collection to be published on the WigoSwap marketplace, please contact us through our BD Telegram account:**
