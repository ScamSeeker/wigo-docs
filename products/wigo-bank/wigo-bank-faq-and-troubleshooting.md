# Wigo Bank FAQ & Troubleshooting

### **Can’t find the Wigo Bank pool in which I have staked my tokens;**

Using the **** ‘Finished’ tab on the Wigo Bank page, you must be able to find the specific pool you are looking for. Moreover, you can use the ‘Staked Only’ button to find your staked tokens more conveniently.&#x20;

### **Can’t unstake the tokens I have staked in the bank;**

This problem could be due the transferring of Wigo Bank (xWIGO) Tokens in your wallet. This token proves that you own the WIGO tokens if you are using the standard staking method in Wigo Bank. Please double-check that you have not sold or transfer the abovementioned tokens.&#x20;

### **The amount of tokens I’ve earned is shown as zero after staking/unstaking;**

## **General Issues** &#x20;

### **The calculation of APR in Wigo Bank;**&#x20;

Wigo Bank APR = Annualized rewards (USD)/Users’ funds staked in the bank (USD) \* 100

For instance, consider a 60-day pool within which the rewards are worth 300,000 USD, and the value of WIGO staked in the pool amounts to 3,000,000. Note that factors such as the price of WIGO and also the reward token, alongside the amount of WIGO staked lead to fluctuations in the APR.

| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Total rewards to distribute (USD value)               |                                   | 300,000 USD       |
| Distribution period                                   |                                   | 60 Days           |
| Daily distribution                                    | 300,000 / 60 =                    | 5,000 USD Daily   |
| **Annualized rewards (USD value)**                    | 5,000 \* 365 =                    | **1,825,000 USD** |
| **Value of WIGO staked by users in pool (USD value)** |                                   | **3,000,000 USD** |
| **APR**                                               | (1,825,000 / 3,000,000) \* 100 =  | **60.83% APR**    |



### **The meaning of ‘End’ number in Wigo Bank;**

This number indicates the remaining time until there are no more rewards for distribution in the bank. Therefore, you should consider unstaking your tokens from the bank once the bank reaches the specific time.&#x20;



### **The source of Wigo Bank rewards;**

The pools on Wigo Bank are categorized as follows:

1\. Stake WIGO to earn WIGO

2\. Stake WIGO to earn other tokens

In the first type, the rewards are generated from WIGO emissions. A number of WIGO tokens are distributed as rewards for these pools every second.

In the second type, the teams behind the projects that sponsor certain pools are responsible for the distribution of rewards.&#x20;



### **Wigo Bank (xWIGO) Token**

By staking manually in Wigo Bank using the Standard Staking method, Wigo Bank (xWIGO) Tokens are deposited into your wallet.
