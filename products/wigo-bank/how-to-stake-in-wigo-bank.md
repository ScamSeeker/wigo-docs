# How to Stake in Wigo Bank

Through staking in Wigo Bank, users are able to earn WIGO (or other tokens) as their reward. While using the farms requires you to stake a pair of tokens, in Wigo Bank you only need to stake WIGO. &#x20;



### **How to Stake?**

1\. Open the Wigo Bank page [here](https://wigoswap.io/bank).&#x20;

2\. On top of the page click on the ‘Connect Wallet’ button to connect your wallet to WigoSwap.&#x20;

3\. After connecting the wallet, you are allowed to choose between two options for staking;&#x20;

**A. Automatic (Auto Compound)** harvests the rewards you’ve earned (WIGO in this example) automatically, and reinvests the rewards in the bank.&#x20;

**B. Standard (Manual Restaking)** on the other hand, does not handle the above process for you automatically. In other words, you have to claim the rewards and restake them into the bank manually if you decide to do so.&#x20;

You can check other Wigo Bank's options to get information on what other tokens you might earn as your reward for staking WIGO.&#x20;

4\. Once you’ve chosen your desired staking option, click on the ‘Enable’ button to proceed.&#x20;

5\. By clicking on the ‘Enable’ button, it changes into ‘Stake’. Click on it to move on to the next step.&#x20;

6\. Enter the amount of WIGO you decide to stake in the bank, or simply choose the percentage of your balance you want to stake into the bank. &#x20;

7\. Click on the ‘Confirm’ button, and confirm the operation in your wallet.&#x20;

8\. After the transaction is processed, you can see the updated amount of the token you’ve staked.&#x20;

9\. Finally, you are able to view the details of your staked token in the bank. If you’ve chosen the Automatic method, you will see a countdown timer that indicates the remaining time until the unstaking fee ends. In case you are using the Standard method, a ‘Collect’ button is there for you to obtain the rewards.&#x20;



### **Add/Remove WIGO from the Bank**

Adding more WIGO to the bank or removing some from the bank involves following a few simple steps on WigoSwap.&#x20;

1\. Click on the + and – buttons to add or remove WIGO from the bank.

If you decide to unstake your tokens from Automatic pool within 72 hours, a 0.5% fee is charged for the process. [More Info](automatic-vs.-standard.md#the-fees-involved-in-automatic-staking)
{% endhint %}

2\. In the next section, you can enter/choose the amount you want to add to the bank (if you’ve clicked on the + button), or enter/choose the amount you decide to remove from the bank (if you’ve clicked on the – button at first).&#x20;

3\. Click on the ‘Confirm’ button and allow the process to be completed.

4\. Finally, you are able to see the updated amount of tokens you’ve staked.&#x20;
