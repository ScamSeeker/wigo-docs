# How to Use Wigo Farms

Using the farms on WigoSwap is an amazing opportunity to earn WIGO. The way Wigo Farms work is different from that of Wigo Bank. While in Wigo Bank users need to stake a single asset to benefit from the rewards, in farms they have to provide the LP tokens received by staking a pair of tokens in the pools. This way, users are able to earn WIGO without the need to disrupt their other positions.

## **Getting Started:**

Setting foot on a farm requires some LP tokens. Farms operate in a way that they only accept the LP tokens that exactly match the specific farm. For instance, WIGO-FTM farms only approve WIGO-FTM LP tokens. The LP tokens could be obtained by adding liquidity to the pool related to a specific pair of tokens. For the sake of clarity, a step-to-step guide is provided:



### **Finding the Farm:**

First and foremost, you need to select the farm that fulfills your desire. You can see a list of available farms [here](https://wigoswap.io/farms). You can sort the farms based on APR, time, etc. When the first step, namely finding the desired farm, is done you can proceed to the next step.&#x20;



### **Getting LP Tokens by Adding Liquidity:**

In order to acquire LP tokens, you need to provide the token pairs with liquidity.&#x20;

1\. Select the specific farm from the list.&#x20;

2\. Among the connected links you can select “Get (e.g. FTM-WIGO) LP Tokens”.

A comprehensive guide to adding liquidity and getting LP tokens can be found here:

2\. After a while the “Stake” button will activate. Click on it.&#x20;

5\. Finally you can view the total amount of LP Tokens you have staked into a farm.



### **Add/Remove LP Tokens from the Farms:**&#x20;

Whenever you decide to add more LP Tokens to a farm or remove some from a specific farm, you are able to do so by following some simple steps:&#x20;

1\. Open the Wigo Farms page. Find the specific farm you’ve staked your LP Tokens in.

2\. Once you’ve found the farm involving your LP tokens, use the + and - buttons to add/remove LP tokens.&#x20;

3\. Then you have to go through a process similar to the one by which you staked your LP tokens. Enter the amount of the LP Tokens you want to stake/unstake, or use the balance amount to enter the entire amount you hold.&#x20;

4\. double-check the details of the action and confirm the operation in your wallet.&#x20;

5\. Finally, you are able to view the new amount of LP tokens you hold for a certain pair. In case you’ve decided to unstake your LP tokens, the rewards have been added to your balance automatically.&#x20;



### **Harvesting the Rewards from Farms:**

By participating in the farming process, you obtain WIGO as the reward. WIGOs can be used to earn more LP Tokens, stake in WIGO bank, etc. Claiming the rewards earned through the process of farming is possible by following the mentioned steps:&#x20;

1\. Open the page related to the farms [here](https://wigoswap.io/farms).&#x20;

2\. From the list, select the farm that contains you LP Tokens. The amount of WIGO you’ve earned through the process of farming is there for you to see.&#x20;

3\. Click on the “Harvest” button and confirm the operation in your wallet. You can see the WIGO balance updated in your wallet after a short time.&#x20;



### **How Often is Appropriate for Harvesting the Rewards?**&#x20;

The frequency of harvesting the rewards is a personal matter. However, you should keep in mind that the process of harvesting the rewards include a small amount of fee. As it can be seen in the picture, the fee involved in the process is shown in your wallet when harvesting the rewards. It is worth noting that the way wallets illustrate the aforementioned fee might be slightly different. All in all, it’s a good idea to let your rewards grow before harvesting them so that you pay fees less frequently.&#x20;
