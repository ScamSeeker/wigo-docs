# How to Stake in WigoBank

Through staking in WigoBank, users are able to earn WIGO as their reward. While using the [WigoFarm](../yield-farming-wigofarm/) requires you to stake a pair of tokens, in WigoBank you only need to stake WIGO. &#x20;



### **How to Stake?**

1\. Open the WigoBank page [here](https://wigoswap.io/bank).&#x20;

2\. On top of the page click on the **Connect** button to connect your wallet to WigoSwap.&#x20;

3\. After connecting the wallet, you are allowed to choose between two options for staking;&#x20;

**A. Staking (Earn WIGO + Auto Compound)** harvests the WIGO rewards you’ve earned automatically, and reinvests the rewards in the same staking pool.&#x20;

**B. Liquid Staking (Earn WIGO + Mint xWIGO)** on the other hand, does not handle the above process for you automatically. In other words, you have to claim the rewards and restake them into the Liquid Staking manually if you decide to do so. By staking on Liquid Staking, [xWIGO](wigobank-faq-and-troubleshooting.md#wigo-bank-xwigo-token) will be minted into your wallet. You must return your xWIGO to unstake your WIGO from the Liquid Staking pool. The amount of xWIGO you return must be the same as the amount of WIGO you unstake.

{% hint style="warning" %}
In case you are using the Liquid Staking in WigoBank, and you decide to unstake your WIGO tokens, you should exactly return as many xWIGO tokens as the WIGO tokens you want to unstake. So be careful not to loss your xWIGO tokens in trades or yield farming. If you don't have enough xWIGO to unstake your staked WIGO tokens, you have to buy more xWIGO tokens from the market. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

You can use your xWIGO tokens as liquidity to earn more passive income in WigoFarm or any other DeFi platform while you are earning staking rewards in WigoBank!

4\. Once you’ve chosen your desired staking option, click on the **Enable** button to proceed.&#x20;

5\. By clicking on the **Enable** button, it changes into **Stake**. Click on it to move on to the next step.&#x20;

6\. Enter the amount of WIGO you decide to stake in the WigoBank, or simply choose the percentage of your balance you want to stake into the WigoBank. &#x20;

7\. Click on the **Confirm** button, and confirm the operation in your wallet.&#x20;

8\. After the transaction is processed, you can see the updated amount of the token you’ve staked.&#x20;

9\. Finally, you are able to view the details of your staked token in the WigoBank. If you’ve chosen the A option, you will see a countdown timer that indicates the remaining time until the unstaking penalty ends. In case you are using the B option, a **Collect** button is there for you to obtain the rewards and you can use your minted xWIGO tokens as liquidity to earn more passive income in WigoFarm or any other DeFi platform.



### **Add/Remove WIGO from the WigoBank**

Adding more WIGO to the WigoBank or removing some from the WigoBank involves following a few simple steps on WigoSwap.&#x20;

1\. Click on the **+** and **–** buttons to add or remove WIGO from the WigoBank.

If you decide to unstake your tokens from Staking (Auto Compound) pool within 72 hours, a 1% fee is charged for the process. [More Info](staking-vs.-liquid-staking.md#the-fees-involved-in-automatic-staking)

{% hint style="warning" %}
By staking in Liquid Staking, xWIGO Tokens are minted into your wallet. These tokens act as the proof of ownership of WIGO tokens you’ve staked in the Liquid Staking pool. Therefore, upon unstaking your WIGO tokens from the Liquid Staking pool, your xWIGO tokens are also automatically de-minted. If you don't have enough xWIGO to unstake, you have to buy more xWIGO tokens from the market.

2\. In the next section, you can enter/choose the amount you want to add to the WigoBank (if you’ve clicked on the **+** button), or enter/choose the amount you decide to remove from the WigoBank (if you’ve clicked on the **–** button at first).&#x20;

3\. Click on the **Confirm** button and allow the process to be completed.

4\. Finally, you are able to see the updated amount of tokens you’ve staked.&#x20;
