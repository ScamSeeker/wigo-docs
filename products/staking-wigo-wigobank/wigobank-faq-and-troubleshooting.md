# WigoBank FAQ & Troubleshooting

### **Can’t find the WigoBank pool in which I have staked my tokens;**

Using the **Finished** tab on the [WigoBank](https://wigoswap.io/bank) page, you must be able to find the specific pool you are looking for. Moreover, you can use the **Staked Only** button to find your staked tokens more conveniently.&#x20;

### **Can’t unstake the tokens I have staked in the WigoBank;**

This problem could be due the lack of xWIGO tokens in your wallet. This token proves that you own the staked WIGO tokens if you are using the Liquid Staking in WigoBank. Please double-check that you have not loss the xWIGO tokens in trades or yield farming.&#x20;

### **The amount of tokens I’ve earned is shown as zero after staking/unstaking;**

As you stake/unstake your assets to or from WigoBank, the rewards you’ve earned are also sent to your wallet simultaneously. So do not panic if you are faced with such a situation.&#x20;

## **General Issues** &#x20;

### **The calculation of APR in WigoBank;**&#x20;

WigoBank APR = Annualized rewards (USD)/Users’ funds staked in the WigoBank pool (USD) \* 100

For instance, consider a 60-day pool within which the rewards are worth 300,000 USD, and the value of WIGO staked in the pool amounts to 3,000,000. Note that factors such as the price of WIGO and also the reward token, alongside the amount of WIGO staked lead to fluctuations in the APR.

| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Total rewards to distribute (USD value)               |                                   | 300,000 USD       |
| Distribution period                                   |                                   | 60 Days           |
| Daily distribution                                    | 300,000 / 60 =                    | 5,000 USD Daily   |
| **Annualized rewards (USD value)**                    | 5,000 \* 365 =                    | **1,825,000 USD** |
| **Value of WIGO staked by users in pool (USD value)** |                                   | **3,000,000 USD** |
| **APR**                                               | (1,825,000 / 3,000,000) \* 100 =  | **60.83% APR**    |



### **The source of WigoBank rewards;**

The rewards are generated from [WIGO emissions](../../tokenomics/rewards-distribution.md). A number of WIGO tokens are distributed as rewards for the WigoBank every second.



### **xWIGO Token**

By staking in WigoBank using the Liquid Staking method, xWIGO Tokens will be minted into your wallet. These tokens act as the proof of ownership of WIGO tokens you’ve staked in the Liquid Staking. Therefore, upon unstaking your WIGO tokens from the WigoBank, xWIGO tokens are also automatically de-minted.

You can use your xWIGO tokens as liquidity to earn more passive income in WigoFarm or any other DeFi platform while you are earning staking rewards in WigoBank!

{% hint style="warning" %}
In case you are using the Liquid Staking in WigoBank, and you decide to unstake your WIGO tokens, you should exactly return as many xWIGO tokens as the WIGO tokens you want to unstake. So be careful not to loss your xWIGO tokens in trades or yield farming. If you don't have enough xWIGO to unstake your staked WIGO tokens, you have to buy more xWIGO tokens from the market.&#x20;
