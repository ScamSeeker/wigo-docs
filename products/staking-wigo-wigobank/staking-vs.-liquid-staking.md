# Staking vs. Liquid Staking

There are two options to stake WIGO and earn more WIGO; Staking (Earn WIGO + Auto Compound) and Liquid Staking (Earn WIGO + Mint xWIGO). Both options allow you to stake WIGO and earn more WIGO tokens. However, there are some differences in the way they work.



### **Staking** (Earn WIGO + Auto Compound) ****&#x20;

* Using this method, the process that includes harvesting the rewards and restaking them into the pool (compounding) is done automatically. However, a tiny amount of fee is charged.&#x20;
* The automatic process of restaking your rewards into the pool is brought about by other users who get a bounty for doing so. (Auto Compound Bounty)
* The interest generated from staking is displayed as APY, which is also considered compounding.&#x20;
* Each time the WigoBank automatically harvests the rewards and reinvests them into the pool (or, to put it simply, each time the WigoBank compounds your rewards), a small fee is deducted from what you’ve earned and burned by [GBM](../../tokenomics/gamified-burning-mechanism-gbm.md). &#x20;
* If you decide to unstake manually within three days, a penalty fee for the unstaking process is also charged and will be burned by [GBM](../../tokenomics/gamified-burning-mechanism-gbm.md). (1%)
* There are no xWIGO Tokens minted into your wallet.

### **Liquid Staking** (Earn WIGO + Mint xWIGO)

* Using this option, users have to claim their earned rewards and restake their rewards (albeit if they decide to do so) in the WigoBank all by themselves. This means the process is not done automatically.&#x20;
* The interest generated through staking is shown as the APR, and it is worth noting that it doesn’t consider compounding.&#x20;
* By staking on Liquid Staking, [xWIGO](wigobank-faq-and-troubleshooting.md#wigo-bank-xwigo-token) will be minted into your wallet. You must return your xWIGO to unstake your WIGO from the Liquid Staking pool. The amount of xWIGO you return must be the same as the amount of WIGO you unstake.
* You can use your xWIGO tokens as liquidity to earn more passive income in WigoFarm or any other DeFi platform while you are earning staking rewards in WigoBank!

### **The Fees Involved in Staking** (Earn WIGO + Auto Compound)

* **There is no fee for depositing.**
* **The unstaking fee is as follows:**

\+ If you decide to unstake within 72 hours, a 1% penalty is charged. This takes place when users unstake manually for 3 days.&#x20;

\+ If you choose to unstake after the 3 days, no fee is involved.&#x20;

\+ Note that every time you manually add more WIGO to the Staking (Auto Compound) pool, the 3 days and the fee involved come into effect.&#x20;

\+ The above fee is charged when users decide to unstake manually. The process of automatic compounding does not include the fee mentioned above.&#x20;

* **The fee for automatic compounding is as follows;**&#x20;

\+ Each time the WigoBank compounds your rewards, a 1% performance fee is subtracted from your earnings. For instance, if you’ve earned 1 WIGO, you would receive 0.99 WIGO, and 0.01 WIGO is subtracted as the fee and will be burned immediately.

The WIGO tokens collected through fees generated through unstaking or compounding are regularly burnt as part of the [GBM](../../tokenomics/gamified-burning-mechanism-gbm.md) plans.

### **The Fees Involved in Standard Staking**&#x20;

* **There is no fee for depositing.**
* **There is no fee for unstaking**



### **The Most Appropriate Way to Use WigoBank**

The best way to use WigoBank is to stake your WIGO tokens in Liquid Staking. By doing so, you can use your xWIGO tokens as liquidity to earn more passive income in WigoFarm or any other DeFi platform while you are earning staking rewards in WigoBank! And the you can stake your rewards on Staking (Auto Compound) to achieve compound interest.\


### **The** Auto Compound Bounty

0.1% of the pending yield of the users who use Staking (Auto Compound) is given as a bounty to those who claim the bounty and, by doing so, trigger the compounding operation for other users. The amount of WIGO you get ought to be higher than the fee you are about to pay for the transaction to submit.
