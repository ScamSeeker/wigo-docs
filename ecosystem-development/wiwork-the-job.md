# âš’ WiWork: The Job

_(In Development)_

WiWork, formerly known as DeTasker, is an upcoming feature in the Wigo Ecosystem. As a decentralized work platform, it seeks to revolutionize the conventional job market by providing a marketplace for services paid in tradable tokens. This promotes economic freedom and flexibility on the blockchain, thereby further completing the Wigo economic ecosystem puzzle.

#### The Vision

In the era of digitization and decentralization, WiWork is envisioned as a platform that transcends geographical and socioeconomic barriers, offering equal opportunities for everyone, everywhere. Inspired by the ethos of blockchain technology, WiWork aims to democratize access to job opportunities, encouraging a culture of inclusivity and fairness in the global workforce.

#### Functionality

WiWork operates as a decentralized marketplace for services, bringing employers and workers together on a single platform. It offers a simple, efficient, and user-friendly platform for individuals and businesses to post job listings and for workers to find employment opportunities.

Users looking to hire can easily post a job listing with a detailed description of the tasks, the skill set required, the deadline, and the payment in terms of tradable tokens. Workers, on the other hand, can browse through the listings, apply for jobs that match their skills, and earn tokens upon the successful completion of tasks.

#### The Token Economy

The innovative aspect of WiWork is its tokenized payment system. WiWork allows for payments to be made in tradable tokens. This not only provides an alternative to traditional payment methods but also introduces a novel way of earning, trading, and investing in the Wigo Ecosystem.

#### Benefits

WiWork brings numerous benefits to its users:

1. **Decentralization**: WiWork eliminates intermediaries and offers direct interaction between employers and workers, thus reducing costs and increasing efficiency.
2. **Global Access**: With its decentralized nature, WiWork is accessible to everyone with an internet connection, regardless of geographical location.
3. **Tokenized Payments**: Workers earn tokens for their services, which can be traded or invested in the Wigo Ecosystem, opening up new financial opportunities.
4. **Security and Transparency**: The blockchain-based system of WiWork ensures secure transactions and a transparent hiring process.
5. **Flexible Work Opportunities**: WiWork offers a variety of job listings, from full-time roles to freelance gigs, catering to diverse skill sets and work preferences.

#### Future Developments

As WiWork continues to evolve, there are plans to introduce more features to enhance the user experience. These include a reputation system to rate employers and workers, a dispute resolution mechanism to ensure fair dealings, and an escrow service to secure payments until job completion.

In conclusion, WiWork is set to redefine the concept of work in the decentralized world. With its tokenized economy, global accessibility, and flexibility, it contributes to the vision of the Wigo Ecosystem - fostering a thriving community where users can learn, earn, play, work, and fund meaningful projects in a decentralized environment.\
