# ðŸ’Ž Space Puzzles

Space Puzzles, a signature innovation within WiGalaxy, embody a thrilling fusion of mystery, gameplay, and blockchain technology. They're hidden quests activated under the most unpredictable conditions and accessible through users' wallets. More than just a gaming experience, Space Puzzles are an adventure â€“ a quest that encourages users to explore the depths of WiGalaxy, sparking curiosity and driving engagement.



**Earning from Exploration: The Reward System**

The spontaneous nature of Space Puzzles creates a sense of exhilaration and unpredictability that fuels user engagement. Unannounced and subject to spontaneous activation, users may find themselves unexpectedly eligible for special quests with substantial rewards, such as Rare Wiggies or Inter-Planet Passports. The spontaneous nature of these rewards amplifies the excitement, as users never know when a puzzle might present itself or what it may lead to.



**Sharing the Wealth: Open-source Treasure Hunting**

The open-source nature of Space Puzzles allows for a unique twist to the metaverse exploration. Brands or individuals can manually bury gems in the galaxy, sparking off a communal treasure hunt that adds to the dynamic nature of WiGalaxy. This encourages user participation, fosters a strong community, and adds an element of surprise to the exploration, making WiGalaxy a continuously engaging and exciting metaverse.



**The Joy of Discovery: Rarity and Surprise**

One of the most appealing aspects of Space Puzzles is the rarity of the rewards. Users may stumble upon a puzzle that has been previously solved by another galaxy resident, adding an additional layer of intrigue and excitement. The joy of discovering a puzzle and the thrill of unlocking its rewards amplify the overall user experience within WiGalaxy, making every exploration a rewarding journey.
