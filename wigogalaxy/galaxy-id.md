# üö© Galaxy ID

The Galaxy ID is an innovative feature within the WigoGalaxy universe, allowing users to create a distinct identity, replete with a personalized Wiggy and a planet to inhabit. This unique identifier offers both a sense of belonging and a gateway to a plethora of exclusive experiences within the WigoGalaxy.

**Components of the Galaxy ID:**

* **Username Minting:** Users have the ability to mint their exclusive usernames, ensuring a unique identity that differentiates them from other adventurers in the WigoGalaxy.
* **Specialized Wiggy:** Along with their unique identity, users also get to mint a tailored Wiggy, a trusty companion that resonates with their chosen identity and enhances their adventures within the universe.
* **Personal Planet:** With the Galaxy ID, users get to choose from a list of fascinating planets such as Planet Boredomia, Planet Westerium, and Planet Ghosterium. Each planet has its unique environment, lore, and hidden gems waiting to be discovered.

**Exclusive Opportunities with Galaxy ID:**

* **Hidden Nebulas:** Owning a Galaxy ID grants users access to exclusive Nebulas available only to residents of their respective planets. These unique challenges and opportunities add another layer of depth and engagement to their WigoGalaxy experience.
* **Planet-Specific Gems:** Each planet is rich in hidden treasures and gems, awaiting discovery by its residents. Galaxy ID owners have the privilege of unearthing these planet-specific riches, adding value to their in-game assets.
* **Group Competitions:** The communal aspect of WigoGalaxy comes alive with Galaxy ID, where users can engage in group-based challenges and competitions, such as trading duels. Not only do these foster camaraderie among users, but they also offer a chance to earn coveted rewards and recognition.
