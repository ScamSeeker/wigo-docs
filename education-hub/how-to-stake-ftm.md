# How to stake FTM

Participate in staking to secure Fantom network and earn FTM tokens as a reward. To stake, you don’t need any particular hardware or device. You can do it directly from your phone or PC.

1- Open the [Fantom fWallet](https://pwawallet.fantom.network/#/) from your computer or your mobile device. Create a new wallet, or access an existing one using mnemonic or a keystore file.
