# ðŸŽ¯ Roadmap

![](.gitbook/assets/Roadmap.jpg)

Commitment, discipline, and motivation lead us to our grand vision.&#x20;

The word â€˜Roadmapâ€™ in the jargon might simply be reminiscent of strict timelines. However, due to the ever-changing nature of the industry, our team is also committed to arranging the priorities following market changes and usersâ€™ needs.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
We update the roadmap based on the needs of the industry and users at least quarterly. If any changes are made to the roadmap, users should be informed in the best way.
