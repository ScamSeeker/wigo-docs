# ðŸ’³ cWIGO (Galactic Credits)

In the vast expanse of WiGalaxy, Galactic Credits, known as cWIGO, serve as the lifeblood of the metaverse economy. The utility of cWIGO extends beyond just being a token of exchange. Instead, it fuels the many adventures within the WiGalaxy Metaverse, acting as the primary reward for user participation and interaction.

As users navigate their way through the WiGalaxy, engaging in quests, solving puzzles, or participating in community events, they earn cWIGO. It embodies the Play-to-Earn model by turning game progression and learning into tangible rewards.

Beyond its role as an in-game currency, cWIGO also serves as a bridge between the virtual and the real, facilitating the purchase and trade of unique NFTs on the WiMart or Bazaar. As such, the generation and distribution of cWIGO are carefully gamified to maintain a balanced and thriving economy within the WiGalaxy Metaverse.

Through cWIGO, WiGalaxy encourages active participation and fosters a sense of community, making the metaverse more than just a playground. It's a dynamic, interactive environment where learning, playing, and earning coalesce, creating a unique metaverse experience that is both fun and rewarding.
