# üö© Land on WiGalaxy

Starting your adventure on WigoGalaxy is as simple as creating a decentralized account. As a new settler, you get to choose a planet to inhabit‚Äîeach with its own unique characteristics and inhabitants. Additionally, you'll be assigned an initial Wiggy companion, a unique NFT that will accompany you throughout your journey in the WigoGalaxy.

Choosing quests to embark on is the next step. Each quest carries objectives which, when completed, earn you rewards ranging from Galactic Credits, Tokens, NFTs, Wiggy companions, to Wiggy level-up assets and more. Each decision you make shapes your journey and the rewards you reap.

Remember, WigoGalaxy is a vast universe filled with opportunities. The more you explore and interact, the more you can earn. Completing quests, finding hidden rewards, and trading on our Bazaar marketplace all contribute to your advancement in WigoGalaxy.
