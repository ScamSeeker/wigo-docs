# ðŸŽ® WiPlay

WiPlay, under the umbrella of WiGalaxy, is a collection of simple, yet engaging blockchain games developed by Wigo for heightened user engagement in the WiGalaxy. Each game is designed with a unique set of rules and rewards, offering an array of exciting experiences for all users within the Wigo Ecosystem.



**First Game: Predict**

The maiden game launched under WiPlay is 'Predict.' This game invites users to forecast the price of the Fantom (FTM) token within 5-minute candlestick intervals. Itâ€™s a game of precision and intuition that adds an element of thrill to the price movements of FTM. The accuracy of the prediction decides the rewards, making 'Predict' not just a game of chance but also of skilled analysis and understanding of the market.



**Upcoming Game: Raffle**

The next game in line for WiPlay is 'Raffle.' Much like a traditional lottery, 'Raffle' participants can win significant token rewards by purchasing tickets.

Facts:

* **Ticket Cost**: A single ticket will cost an amount set in the WIGO tokens equivalent to \~$X USD.
* **Entry Limit**: Users can purchase up to Y tickets at a time, with no overall limit.
* **Ticket Numbers**: Each ticket purchase generates a unique 6-digit number ranging from 0-9. For instance, "1-9-3-2-0-4."
* **Winning**: Numbers are matched from the left to win. The more numbers that match, the bigger the prize pool you'll share.
* **Security**: 'Raffle' utilizes Chainlink's implementation of Verifiable Random Function (VRF) for secure and reliable randomness in number generation.
* **Bulk Purchase Discount**: Multiple ticket purchases at once yield bulk discounts, starting at 2 tickets and scaling up to 4.95% at 100 tickets.
* **Prize Sharing**: The prize amount won depends on the number of other winners in the same prize bracket. The more winners, the smaller the share of the prize pool per ticket.



**Conclusion**

WiPlay serves as a testament to the philosophy of 'Play-to-Earn' embedded in WiGalaxy. The games under WiPlay not only entertain users but also offer substantial rewards, keeping the user engagement high and the ecosystem thriving. So, whether you're an analyst predicting market movements or a hopeful participant in a lottery draw, WiPlay offers something for everyone in the WiGalaxy.
