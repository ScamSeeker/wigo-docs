# ðŸ’° xWIGO

xWIGO is a 1:1 token backed by staked WIGO tokens in WigoBank. Therefore, the total supply of this token is always equal to the sum of staked WIGO tokens in WigoBank.

By staking in WigoBank using the Liquid Staking method, xWIGO Tokens will be minted into your wallet. These tokens act as the proof of ownership of WIGO tokens youâ€™ve staked in the Liquid Staking. Therefore, upon unstaking your WIGO tokens from the WigoBank, xWIGO tokens are also automatically de-minted.

You can use your xWIGO tokens as liquidity to earn more passive income in WigoFarm or any other DeFi platform while you are earning staking rewards in WigoBank!

{% hint style="warning" %}
In case you are using the Liquid Staking in WigoBank, and you decide to unstake your WIGO tokens, you should exactly return as many xWIGO tokens as the WIGO tokens you want to unstake. So be careful not to loss your xWIGO tokens in trades or yield farming. If you don't have enough xWIGO to unstake your staked WIGO tokens, you have to buy more xWIGO tokens from the market.&#x20;

### FAQ: Why is the xWIGO's supply in [FTMScan](https://ftmscan.com/address/0xb9bbe9355828a1ad0e2d605480f969c6903ad9e4) is not equal to the number of staked in Liquid Staking pool?

The difference is due to the xWIGO tokens that WigoVault (Auto Compound) contract owns. This smart contract compounds the users' fund, so it does not give the xWIGO tokens back to its users. The total supply of xWIGO is always equal to the sum of all staked WIGO tokens in WigoBank. (Staking + Liquid Staking)
