# WIGO Tokenomics

![](<../.gitbook/assets/tokenomics (1).png>)

WIGO is the native governance token of WigoSwap’s ecosystem. The maximum supply (hard-cap) determined for WIGO token is 2,000,000,000.&#x20;

## **Initial Supply**

8% of the Max Supply is intended for the initial mint that is planned to be minted by WigoSwap team at deployment time. The determined proportions are as follows:

| Allocation Category        |  % of Max Supply | Number of Tokens |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Seed Funders               | 3.0%             | 60,000,000       |
| Community Airdrops         | 3.0%             | 60,000,000       |
| Initial Dex Offering (IDO) | 2.0%             | 40,000,000       |
| **Total**                  | **8.0%**         | **160,000,000**  |

{% hint style="info" %}
WIGO does not have any pre-sale, private sale, public sale or ICO.
{% endhint %}

### **Initial DEX Offering (IDO)**&#x20;

2% of WIGO’s maximum supply (40,000,000 **** WIGOs), alongside $50,000 in FTM are allocated to the Initial DEX Offering. Therefore, the initial price of WIGO would be around $0.00125 at the beginning of the IDO. The LP tokens generated through establishing the initial pool, and received by WigoSwap core team will be locked for 365 days and will not be used in farming.

### **Vesting Schedule**&#x20;

In what follows you can see the vesting schedule related to the seed **** funders:

* 12% Initial Allowance
* 22% after 60 days
* 22% after 120 days
* 22% after 180 days
* 22% after 240 days

The rest of the supply is going to be minted over time as follows:

| Allocation Category         |  % of Max Supply | Number of Tokens  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Farming and Staking Rewards | 80.0%            | 1,600,000,000     |
