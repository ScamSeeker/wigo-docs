# Create a Fantom Wallet

In order to make use of the services and features on WigoSwap, before anything else you need to set up a wallet that is compatible with the [Fantom](https://fantom.foundation) Blockchain. There are plenty of wallets available for desktop computers and smartphones. Therefore, choosing the suitable wallet is entirely up to you. We suggest using [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) on desktop because when you connect MetaMask to WigoSwap, it will automatically configured to work with Fantom Opera so you do not need to make any additional setup.

When you're setting up a wallet, be sure to:

✅ Download and install only the latest version from an official source.

✅ Follow the setup guide carefully.

✅ Safely back up your recovery phrases.

❌ NEVER share your recovery phrases with anyone, under any circumstances.

❌ NEVER input your recovery phrase to a website or app, other than your wallet app
