# üè¶ WigoSwap Overview

WigoSwap is a fundamental component of the Wigo ecosystem, serving as its primary decentralized exchange (DEX). WigoSwap is designed with a vision to create a fair, secure, and sustainable environment for yield farming, all while offering a seamless trading experience to users. The WigoSwap DEX fosters an environment where users can trade tokens securely, engage in liquidity farming, and contribute to the growth and sustainability of the Wigo ecosystem.



**Sustainable and Fair Yield Farming**

WigoSwap introduces the concept of sustainable and fair yield farming to ensure that users can maximize their earnings in a risk-managed environment. Utilizing an automated market maker (AMM) model, WigoSwap provides fair opportunities for all participants, no matter the size of their contribution. With an emphasis on long-term sustainability, WigoSwap promotes yield farming practices that balance rewarding returns with economic resilience.



**The $WIGO token**

The $WIGO token is the native token of the Wigo ecosystem, serving as a key to its numerous functionalities. Users can use $WIGO to participate in yield farming, governance, staking, and to pay for transaction fees on the WigoSwap DEX. With a capped supply, $WIGO ensures a scarcity factor, maintaining the token‚Äôs value and sustainability in the long term. The $WIGO token is designed to incentivize active participation in the ecosystem, rewarding users for their contributions to the community.



**Galaxy Burning Module (GBM): Inflating Opportunities, Deflating Risks**

The Galaxy Burning Module, or GBM, is a unique mechanism introduced by WigoSwap to ensure the longevity and sustainability of $WIGO tokens. It is an automatic, gamified burning process that helps maintain a balanced token economy. The GBM counteracts inflationary pressures by burning a portion of $WIGO tokens during transactions, effectively reducing the total supply. This process helps inflate opportunities for users while deflating the risks associated with token inflation, ensuring richer yields and more opportunities for NFT use-cases.



**Cross-chain Capabilities**

WigoSwap sets itself apart with its cross-chain capabilities, enabling users to trade tokens across multiple blockchains. This interoperability reduces the barriers between different blockchain communities, allowing a more diverse range of assets to be traded on WigoSwap. With its cross-chain functionality, WigoSwap not only broadens the possibilities for traders but also contributes to the overall goal of blockchain interoperability, bringing us one step closer to a unified and interconnected blockchain ecosystem.
