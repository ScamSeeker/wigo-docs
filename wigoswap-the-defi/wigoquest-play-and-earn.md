# üé≤ WigoQuest: Play and Earn

**Introduction to WigoQuest**

WigoQuest introduces a dynamic layer of gamification to the WigoSwap platform, offering users a compelling way to engage with various tasks while earning rewards. Embedded within WigoSwap, WigoQuest serves as a bridge between traditional swap functionalities and interactive, reward-based activities.



**How WigoQuest Works**

WigoQuest revolves around single quests ‚Äî distinct tasks that users can complete to earn rewards. To participate, **users must first register their profile on WigoSwap**. This registration is the gateway to a plethora of quests, each designed with specific goals and rewards in mind.



**Quest Dynamics**

1. **Active and Expired Quests:** At any given time, WigoQuest features a selection of available quests, including 'hot quests' which are currently active and offer timely rewards. Quests have a defined lifecycle, starting from an active state and moving to an expired status upon reaching their deadline or completion metrics.
2. **Quest Details:**
   * Title and Information: Each quest is clearly outlined with a title and additional details provided in a subheader, guiding users through the requirements and rewards.
   * NFT Minting: A unique aspect of WigoQuest is the NFT reward system. The platform displays the number of NFTs minted for each quest, indicating the quest's popularity and the number of users who have successfully claimed the reward.
   * Start and End Dates: Quests are time-bound, with a specified start date and either a fixed or open-ended completion date. This structure ensures a steady refresh of opportunities for users to engage with.
3. **Rewards:**
   * WigoQuest offers a diverse rewards system primarily focused on NFTs and points. Each quest outlines its reward structure, providing clear incentives for participation.
4. **Claiming Rewards:**
   * Upon completing a quest, users are prompted to claim their rewards, further integrating the WigoQuest experience with the user's achievements visible on their profile.
5. **Integration with the profile (WigoGalaxy):**
   * Achievements and completed quests are recorded and showcased in the user's profile on WigoSwap, offering a comprehensive view of their journey and accomplishments within the Wigo ecosystem.
