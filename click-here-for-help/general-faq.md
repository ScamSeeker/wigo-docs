## **What is the difference between staking and farming?**

Both services give you rewards in the form of WIGO tokens in return for your support for the platform. To understand the difference, it is worth noting that staking means you stake WIGO tokens in Wigo Bank, and earn WIGO or other tokens as your reward. A guide to staking in Wigo Bank is provided here:
